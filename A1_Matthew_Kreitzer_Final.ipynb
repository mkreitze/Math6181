        "## General Problem: <br /> \n",
        "Develop a function \"Markov_chain_sim\" which simulates one update of a Markov chain given the: initial state; $X_0 \\in S$ (with $S$ being the state space with elements $\\{0, ... ,N_{state} - 1\\}$ and $N_{state} \\in \\mathbb{N}$), the transition matrix; $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_{state} × N_{state}}$ and a random uniform variable on $(0,1)$; $U$ .  <br /> \n",
        "### Solution: \n",
        "To simulate a Markov chain, consider what $X_1$ could be, given any $U$. In other words, consider the probability distribution of going from $X_0$ to any other state. <br />\n",
        "This probability distribution is represented by a row of the transition matrix $P$. To find the exact row, simply enumerate $S$ (this is technically already done for us) and generate $P$ using the enumerated states as the dimensions in the matrix. This allows the enumerated value of every state in $S$ to have a probability distribution represented by the same row in $P$. Thus the probability distribution of $X_0$ going to another state is the row of $P$ with the enumerated value of $X_0$. <br />\n",
        "Next, we must define how $U$ can change the state of $X_0$. That is to say, what does a value of $U = 0.8$ mean? In terms of convention, we shall consider $U$ changing $X_0$ to the value of column whose cumulative sum contains the value of $U$. This is best explained using the simple example below. <br />\n",

        "Since a probability distribution sums to one, it must be changed. To do this we take the cumulative sums of the elements in $P[X_0]$, then find which summed interval $U$ fits in, this interval giving $X_1$. While a seemingly daunting task to code up, it can easily be done using the numpy library.<br />\n",

        "While the Markov chain can accurately predict the chance for rainy or sunny, it is an approximation. To get an exact answer, the following equation must be solved:\n",
        "$$ v_{∞} = v_{∞}*P$$\n",
        "This equation is solved by computing the eigenvector eigenvalue problem. Relating this to the power method to find $x_i$ earlier, eigenvectors with eigenvalues less than one will converge to zero while eigenvalues larger than one will produce no limit, and therefore no answer. This means only eigenvectors with eigenvalues of 1 can converge. Thus $v_{∞}$ will be the eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 1. As seen in class $v_{∞}$ must be unique therefore, $v_{∞}$ will be the scaled eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 1. The code block below calculates $v_{∞}$ for this problem. <br />\n",
        "Also, it should be noted that the initial state does not affect $v_{∞}$, this is a consequence of the Markov chains states being fully connected. \n",

A player takes a turn by rolling this dice, and gaining temporary score depending on the face rolled. The score for each is defined before the game begins. A player continues rolling until they either bank their temporary score, or achieve the fail state (or states). After this the other player takes their turn. <br> \n"

        "To simplify the problem to elucidate playing strategies, consider the game of PIG played only with a six sided die where a roll of $1$ fails, and every other roll adds itself to the players temporary score. To optimally play, a player needs to maximize their expected score $E$ and minimize their chance of failure $p_{bust}$.<br />\n",
        "Thus question becomes, what is the optimal score $s*$ which minimizes risk and maximizes the expected score. Given rolling a $1$ occurs $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the time, $p_{bust} = \\frac{1}{6}$. Similarly, the average score, when the player doesn’t fail, is $s_{expected} = \\frac{\\sum^6_{n=0}(i)}{6} = 4$. Noticing that as subsequent rolls are done, our scores stack additively and our failure probabilities stack multiplicatively, the general formula becomes $E_{n} = p_{fail}^n*(ns_{expected})= 4n\\frac{5}{6}^n$. This function can be maximized via calculus giving; \n",
        "$$E'(n) = \\frac{d}{dn}4n\\frac{5}{6}^n = \\frac{5}{3}^n*2^{2-n}*(1-nln(\\frac{6}{5}))$$  \n",

        "Since we need an integer number of rolls, this value can be rounded up or down with a perceived 'risk'. For example, choosing $n = 5$ we choose a slightly 'safer' strategy. To find the optimized score, we can just take this value and multiply it by the expected score per roll, $4$. This gives $s^* = 20$. \n",
        "<br />\n",
        "(a) Can also be done by finding the expected value which first attains \"at no loss\" in its expectation after another roll. That is to say find $n$ such that $s^* = E(4+s^*) \\rightarrow s^* = \\frac{5}{6}(4+s^*) \\rightarrow s^* = 20$. In this case forcing $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and changing the equality to $ <, >$ or $=$ can be perceived as choosing 'safe', 'risky' or 'standard' strategies. <br />\n",
        "The issue with the strategy of \"roll until 20 points banked\" comes from implementing this into a competitive game. Consider both players are trying to attain a score $s_{target}$. Well if both players continue playing with $s^*$ the player going first will win on average as the they can gain score before their opponent. Additionally, players may not get 20 point exactly. For example, rolling 5+6+5+6 = 21. A player following $s*$ would attain 21 points. To account for these random outcomes, the players strategies must change. <br />\n",
        "In other words, since PIG is a game where dynamic strategy is required. For example, the second player can counteract the bias against them by initially taking a higher risk and hoping for better payout, or by taking a safer strategy and wait for the first player to fail. For example:\n",

        "To start we must define our state space. The naive choice works and uses every possible score until the target. The state of failure needs to be represented, so we must also include $\\phi$. More mathematically gives; $S = \\{ i \\in \\mathbb{N} | i \\leq s_{target} \\} \\cup {\\phi}.$ With this state space, we can generate $P$. To see the patterns to do so, consider  the transition from some score state $s_{cur}$.\n",

        "Given that the score is $s_{cur}$ the future score will simply be $s_{cur} + s_{rolled}$. To make things simple let us consider $s_{cur} + s_{max} \\leq s_{target}$. So the state we transition to is simply $s_{cur} + s_{rolled}$. The question becomes, what is the probability to rolling every score? This is represented by the elements of $v$. Of course to even get any score, we must not fail, given these are independent events each score has the probability $p_{score_i} =  v_i*p_{bust}$. Of course this gives also gives the transition of going to the $\\phi$ state, which is $p_{bust}$ by definition.  If the states are enumerated properly (lining up the $s_i$ score to be the $s_i$ row) we get the following row of $P$: \n",

        "The only case not accounted for is $s_{cur} + max(s_{rolled}) > s_{target}$. In this case, all of the probabilities from attaining a sufficient enough score $ s \\geq s_{target}- max(s_{rolled})$ stack up additively resulting in the row:\n",

        "## The effect of runners:\n",
        "Can't Stop has a very interesting rule when it comes to scoring. Unlike most games, the players choose where to score depending on what they initially roll. For example, a player first rolls $4,5,2,2$. This gives the possible scores as $9,4$ or $6,7$. The player then chooses to score in either and places runners in these columns. This choice means the first roll is effectively 'free' as any value (minus only rolling the already completed columns), is a success. Thus to chose $p_{bust}$ there are two main cases that must be considered. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Simple case:\n",
        "Consider if there is a full set of runners. In this case the probability from prob_to_miss_targets exactly represents the chance to miss the runner columns. Provided a player can only put runners in columns that are not already completed, the runner position array just need to be converted into a boolean array. This can be done by subtracting the runner positions from a boolean array the same size as the illegals array, but only filled with True as its value. In code this is:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "jnp.ones_like(illegals) - runnerPos\n",
        "```\n",
        "Note the jnp.ones function generates a boolean array filled with trues of the desired size. This works since a negative number evaluates as False, so no matter the position of the runners (unless they are somehow negative) <br/> \n",
        "\n",
        "## Not as simple case:\n",
        "Consider we have less than the full set of runners. In this case, the player can roll anything except the already filled columns. In other words, player only busts, if they only roll the filled columns. This can be computed as the  chance to miss everything but the illegal columns. This is represented by:\n",
